# Cypress CapSense Middleware Library

### Overview
CapSense is a Cypress capacitive sensing solution. Capacitive sensing can be used in a variety of applications
and products where conventional mechanical buttons can be replaced with sleek human interfaces to transform
the way users interact with electronic systems. These include home appliances, and automotive, IoT, and industrial applications.
* Offers best-in-class signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
* Supports Self-Capacitance (CSD) and Mutual-Capacitance (CSX) sensing methods
* Features SmartSense auto-tuning technology for CSD sensing to avoid complex manual tuning process
* Supports various Widgets, such as Buttons, Matrix Buttons, Sliders, Touchpads, and Proximity Sensors
* Provides ultra-low power consumption and liquid-tolerant capacitive sensing technology
* Contains the integrated graphical CapSense Tuner tool for real-time tuning, testing, and debugging
* Provides superior immunity against external noise and low-radiated emission
* Offers best-in-class liquid tolerance
* Supports one-finger and two-finger gestures
* Provides flash optimization
* Supports protocol-agnostic tuning (UART, SPI, etc.)

### Quick Start
The CapSense Configurator Help describes step-by-step instruction how to configure and launch CapSense operation. The tool can be launched in ModusToolbox IDE from the CSD personality, as well as in stand-alone mode (the tool is included into PSOC 6 SDK 2.0).
